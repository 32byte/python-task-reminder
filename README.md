# Python task reminder:

## File format
```
File format v2: 
    This format is very simmilar to the crontab format.
    You can check it out here: https://crontab.guru/

    Basically it goes like this:
    MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH DAY(WEEK)

    I would really recommend checking out the website above.
    You can click on the tags (minute, hour, day, etc.) to see valid input

Not implemented yet:
    Value list seperator with ','
    Ranges with '-'
    Step values with '/'

    @yearly, etc are currently not planned to be implemented.
```

## How to setup (work in progress)
```
For now the code doesn't really do anything
but this would be a guide on how to set it up once it's done.

1. Create/Select a gmail account you want to use.
2. Enable less secure apps for it with this link:
    https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
3. Create and edit the tasks.txt file
4. Upload all the files on where you want to host it and keep the app running
